## Project Title
Low-carbon Traffic Flow Optimizer

## Problem Statement Addressed
"How might we build and deploy technology-driven solutions that actively promote cleaner, greener communities and environmental sustainability?"

**Specific Focus:**  
Reduce urban fuel waste and CO‚ÇÇ emissions by optimizing city traffic flow with **Deep Learning**, **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**, and an **LLM** for driver/policy insights.

## Project Overview
Urban traffic congestion causes vehicles to idle, wasting fuel and increasing carbon emissions. Our solution combines **DL**, **RL**, and **LLMs** to:
- Analyze city traffic camera feeds in real-time.
- Detect and map congestion patterns using a Deep Learning computer vision model.
- Apply a Reinforcement Learning agent to test adaptive traffic signal timings that reduce idling and improve flow.
- Use a Large Language Model to automatically generate daily tips for drivers (eco-driving, best routes) and policy briefs for city planners (estimated fuel savings, CO‚ÇÇ reductions).

## Key Features
- üì∑ **Traffic Camera Analysis:** CNN-based model to detect congestion zones, traffic density, and flow speed.
- ü§ñ **Reinforcement Learning Signal Control:** RL agent simulates and optimizes green/red signal durations to reduce idle time.
- üìù **LLM-Powered Reports:** Generates clear, plain-language daily updates ‚Äî driver tips, carbon savings, and policy suggestions.
- üìä **Dashboard (Optional):** Shows live traffic status, CO‚ÇÇ savings estimates, and RL recommendations.

## Additional Notes
- **Data Sources:** Open city traffic cam feeds, simulated traffic scenarios (e.g., SUMO traffic simulator).
- **Tech Stack:** Python, TensorFlow/Keras (DL), OpenAI Gym for RL, Hugging Face for LLM, Flask/Streamlit for dashboard.
- **Challenges:** Real-time video feed processing, safe RL policy simulation, making LLM tips actionable.
- **Future Plans:** Integration with city traffic control systems, multi-city scaling, multilingual driver advice.
